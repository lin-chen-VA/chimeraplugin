    "## Small Molecule Monte Carlo Simulation Program (SMMCSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> SMMCSP is a Monte Carlo simulation program written during my Master study at\n",
    "> New Mexico State University (NMSU). \n",
    "\n",
    "> In 2005, I joined Dr. David E. Smith research\n",
    "> group in Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at NMSU. At that time, Dr.\n",
    "> Smith focused on the simulaiton of water in single wall carbon tube. He had a\n",
    "> code writtein in Fortran 77. I started a simulation of purifying small\n",
    "> chemicals from aquatic solutions with Dr. Smith's Fortran code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> From 2005 to 2008, I wrote a couple of versions of code for different simulation\n",
    "> systems. Writing code was easy. I spent a week to have a runnable code. However, \n",
    "> debuging code is painful. It is very often that I spent over 20 hours computer time\n",
    "> to check if a result from simulation matches the paper reported value. The whole\n",
    "> debug process usually took over a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 2008, I received a project from Dr. Smith simulating water in clay. At that time,\n",
    "> I took C++ programming in Department of Computer Science. I decided to write a\n",
    "> general small molecule Monte Carlo simulation program, by which I can simulate\n",
    "> different system. Dr. Smith supported my ideas and helped me validate the results\n",
    "> generated from this generic program.\n",

    "### Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### input.in\n",
    "* Fixed molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "> To represent the fixed polymers, like carbon nanotube, the modules can be setup as fixed.\n",
    "> No movement will be implemented on these molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-fixed molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "> To represent the movable molecules, like water molecules, the modules can be randomly\n",
    "> selected and moved\n",
    "\n",
    "#### model.in\n",
    "\n",
    "> The templates of molecules of non-fixed molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### parameter.in\n",
    "\n",
    "> The paramters for a specific simulation system\n",
    "\n",
    "#### system.in\n",
    "\n",
    "> System parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### gr.out\n",
    "\n",
    "> pair-correlation funciton\n",
    "\n",
    "#### number.out\n",
    "\n",
    "> molecule numbers in each iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### output.out\n",
    "\n",
    "> molecule coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "### output.pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "> It was a output of molecules in pdb format. However, since the pdb format has been adjusted, VMD cannot open the output pdb file anymore. If there is a chance, it will be adjusted.\n"
